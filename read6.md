# **Color** 
The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:


## rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up. For
example: rgb(100,100,90)


 ## hex codes
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign. For example: #ee3e80
color names
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers. For example:
DarkCyan


## **background-color**
CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.
You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors: RGB values,
hex codes, and color names

>Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
>green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

You can specify your color values in various formats. Following table lists all the possible formats âˆ’

Contrast
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible.


## opacity
CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).



## HSL Colors
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.


 ## hsl, hsla
The hsl color property has
been introduced in CSS3 as an
alternative way to specify colors.
The value of the property starts
with the letters hsl, followed
by individual values inside
parentheses for:
hue
This is expressed as an angle
(between 0 and 360 degrees).
saturation
This is expressed as a
percentage.
lightness
This is expressed as a
percentage with 0% being white,
50% being normal, and 100%
being black.
The hsla color property allows
you to specify color properties
using hue, saturation, and
lightness as above, and adds a
fourth value which represents
transparency (just like the rgba
property). The a stands for:
alpha
This is expressed as a
number between 0 and 1.0.
For example, 0.5 represents
50% transparency, and 0.75
represents 75% transparency
