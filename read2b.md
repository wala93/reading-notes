 # Remote Repositories
 
 In order to collaborate on Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories, versions of a project residing online or on a network. You can work with multiple repositories, for which you can have read/write or read-only privileges. 
 Teams can use remote repositories to push information to and pull data from.
 
 ## so :
 
 you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles,By running the **git remote** command.
 
   By using **git remote -v**, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
   
   for example :
   
   
   > $ cd example

  > $ git remote -v

> remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)

> remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)

> remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)

> remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)

> remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)

> remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)
